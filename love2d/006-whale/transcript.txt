draw me a whale using love2d. feel free to generate assets or vectorize the wahle, but it should be recognizable.

Vectorized Whale in LÖVE2D
I'll create a vectorized whale drawing using LÖVE2D's shape drawing capabilities. The solution will render a recognizable whale with some simple animation to make it swim.

Step-by-step solution:
Create the main structure with LÖVE2D callbacks
Add functions to draw a whale using primitive shapes
Implement simple animation for swimming motion
Add some bubbles for an underwater effect
main.lua
Complete implementation of a vectorized whale drawing:

main.lua
The whale is drawn using basic shapes:

The body is a large ellipse
The head is a smaller ellipse
The fins and tail are triangular polygons
The eye consists of a white circle with a black pupil
The blowhole is a small circle
The mouth is a simple line
The whale gently bobs up and down, and bubbles appear to come from the blowhole, creating a simple animation effect. The color scheme uses a deep blue for the whale and a light blue background to represent water.

can you make the whale look more realistic?

Enhanced Realistic Whale in LÖVE2D
I'll improve the whale drawing to make it look more realistic by adding better shading, anatomical details, and texture.

Step-by-step improvements:
Refine the whale's overall shape to match a real blue whale
Add gradient coloring and shading effects
Create more detailed fins and tail flukes
Add skin texture and subtle details
Improve the water and lighting effects
main.lua
Here are the changes to make the whale look more realistic:

main.lua
The whale is now much more realistic with these improvements:

Better shape anatomy: The body is proportioned more like an actual blue whale with a tapering streamlined form
Enhanced coloration: Added a lighter belly and deeper blue topside with natural color variations
Realistic details: Added baleen plates, throat grooves, and a more accurate blowhole
Texture and shading: Added skin texture using tiny dots and subtle color variations
Improved environment: Created underwater light rays and a water surface effect
Better fins and tail: The fins and tail are more curved and anatomically correct
Eye detail: The eye has depth with iris, pupil and highlight
More natural movement: The whale moves with a gentle swimming motion that's more realistic
The underwater environment is also more immersive with surface effects, variable bubble patterns, and light rays filtering through the water.

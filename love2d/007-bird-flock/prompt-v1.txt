-- Love2D Flocking Simulation - Detailed Implementation Request

-- Goal: Create a complete, working Love2D program that simulates a flock of birds using the Boids algorithm.
-- The program should be well-structured, commented, and easily modifiable.

-- --------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Data Structures
-- --------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Define a table to represent a single bird.
-- Each bird should have the following properties:
--   x: (number) x-coordinate of the bird's position.
--   y: (number) y-coordinate of the bird's position.
--   velocityX: (number) x-component of the bird's velocity.
--   velocityY: (number) y-component of the bird's velocity.
--   maxSpeed: (number) Maximum speed of the bird.
--   maxForce: (number) Maximum steering force that can be applied.
--   perceptionRadius: (number) Radius within which the bird considers other birds for flocking behavior.

-- Create a global table called 'birds' to store all bird objects.

-- 3. Love2D Callbacks (Provide complete implementations)
-- --------------------------------------------------------------------

function love.load()
  -- Initialize the 'birds' table with 50 birds.
  -- For each bird:
  --   - Set its x and y position randomly within the screen bounds (use love.graphics.getWidth() and love.graphics.getHeight()).
  --   - Set its velocityX and velocityY randomly between -50 and 50.
  --   - Set its maxSpeed to 100.
  --   - Set its maxForce to 5.
  --   - Set its perceptionRadius to 50.
end

function love.update(dt)
  -- Update the position and velocity of each bird in the 'birds' table.
  -- For each bird:
  --   1. Calculate the separation, alignment, and cohesion forces using the helper functions.
  --   2. Apply weights to the forces:
  --      - Separation weight: 2.0
  --      - Alignment weight: 1.0
  --      - Cohesion weight: 1.0
  --   3. Calculate the total acceleration by adding the weighted forces.
  --   4. Update the bird's velocity by adding the acceleration (multiplied by dt).
  --   5. Limit the bird's velocity to its maxSpeed using vector normalization and scaling if necessary.
  --   6. Update the bird's position by adding its velocity (multiplied by dt).
  --   7. Implement wrap-around boundary conditions:
  --      - If the bird's x position goes beyond the screen width, wrap it around to the left edge.
  --      - If the bird's x position goes beyond the left edge, wrap it around to the right edge.
  --      - Do the same for the y position and the screen height.

end

function love.draw()
  -- Draw each bird as a filled triangle.
  -- For each bird:
    -- 1. Calculate the angle of the bird's velocity using math.atan2(bird.velocityY, bird.velocityX).
    -- 2. Use love.graphics.polygon to draw a filled triangle:
    --    - The triangle should point in the direction of the bird's velocity.
    --    - Use the calculated angle to rotate the triangle points.
    --    - A suggested size is a triangle with one point 10 pixels ahead of the bird's center and two points 5 pixels behind and to the sides.
    --    - Example points (before rotation):
    --        (bird.x + 10, bird.y), (bird.x - 5, bird.y + 5), (bird.x - 5, bird.y - 5)
    -- 3. Set a different color using for example: love.graphics.setColor(1, 0, 0) -- red

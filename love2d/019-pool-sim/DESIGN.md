# Pool Physics Demo Design Document

## Overview
A technical demonstration of LÖVE2D's physics capabilities through a streamlined pool (billiards) simulator. This demo focuses on accurate physics implementation while maintaining essential gameplay mechanics.

## Core Technical Demo Goals
- Showcase LÖVE2D's physics engine capabilities
- Demonstrate realistic ball collisions and momentum transfer
- Provide a playable 9-ball pool experience with minimal assets
- Create a clear visual representation of physics principles in action

## Physics Implementation

### Physics Engine Focus
- Ball-to-ball collision demonstrations with proper momentum
- Basic friction simulation for the table surface
- Simplified spin effects (english) to demonstrate rotational physics
- Accurate cushion rebounds to show angle conservation
- Demonstration of velocity decay through linear damping

### Ball Properties
- 10 balls total (cue ball + 9 numbered balls)
- Consistent mass and size properties for predictable physics
- Simple colored circles with numbers (no detailed textures required)

## Technical Specifications

### LÖVE2D Physics Implementation
- Utilize `love.physics` for all collision and movement
- World setup with zero gravity for top-down simulation
- CircleShape bodies for balls with appropriate:
  - Density (~1.0)
  - Restitution (~0.9) for realistic bounce
  - Angular and linear damping to simulate friction
- Static EdgeShape bodies for table cushions
- Sensor fixtures for pockets
- Custom collision callbacks for gameplay logic

### Minimal Implementation Strategy
- Physics-focused architecture with simple visuals
- Placeholder graphics with emphasis on physics visualization
- Debug rendering options to show collision bodies and vectors
- Limited use of complex coding abstractions

## Player Interaction
- Mouse aiming with visible trajectory line
- Power control via click-and-drag
- Basic english/spin application through key modifiers
- Restart option after completion

## Development Priorities
1. Accurate physics simulation
2. Responsive ball control
3. Functional gameplay loop
4. Clear visualization of physics properties
5. Basic UI for player feedback

This technical demo prioritizes demonstrating LÖVE2D's physics capabilities while providing a functional pool game experience with minimal asset requirements.

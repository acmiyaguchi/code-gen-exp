# MicroKanren in Lua: Solving the 99 Prolog Problems

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design and implementation of a microKanren logic programming system in Lua. The primary goal is to solve the 99 Prolog problems using this custom microKanren implementation, while ensuring robust unit testing.

## 2. Goals

* Implement a minimal but functional microKanren core in Lua.
* Solve the 99 Prolog problems using the implemented microKanren.
* Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests for both the core and problem solutions.
* Maintain a clean, well-organized, and maintainable codebase.

## 3. Architecture

The project is structured into the following components:

* **`microkanren.lua` (Core Implementation):** Contains the core logic of the microKanren system, including data structures (terms, substitutions, streams) and functions (unification, goal combinators).
* **`problems/` (Problem Solutions):** Houses the Lua modules that implement solutions to the 99 Prolog problems using the microKanren core.
* **`tests/` (Unit Tests):** Contains the unit tests for both the core implementation and the problem solutions, using the Busted testing framework.

### 3.1. MicroKanren Core

* **Data Structures:**
    * **Terms:** Represented as Lua tables with `type` fields (`var`, `val`, `pair`).
    * **Substitutions:** Lua tables (dictionaries) mapping variable IDs to terms.
    * **Streams:** Lazy sequences of substitutions implemented using Lua coroutines.
* **Functions:**
    * `var(x)`: Creates a logic variable.
    * `val(x)`: Creates a value term.
    * `pair(a, b)`: Creates a pair term.
    * `unify(u, v, s)`: Unifies terms `u` and `v` under substitution `s`.
    * `walk(u, s)`: Follows variable chains in substitution `s`.
    * `ext_s(x, v, s)`: Extends substitution `s` with a new binding.
    * `mzero()`: Creates an empty stream.
    * `unit(s)`: Creates a stream with a single substitution.
    * `bind(stream, goal)`: Applies a goal to each substitution in a stream.
    * `disj(g1, g2)`: Creates a disjunctive goal (OR).
    * `conj(g1, g2)`: Creates a conjunctive goal (AND).
    * `call_fresh(f)`: Creates a fresh logic variable.
    * `take(n, stream)`: Takes the first `n` substitutions from a stream.

### 3.2. Problem Solutions

* Each Prolog problem is implemented as a separate Lua module within the `problems/` directory.
* Problem solutions are defined as microKanren goals, utilizing the core functions.
* Data structures (lists, etc.) are represented using Lua tables.

### 3.3. Unit Tests

* The Busted testing framework is used for unit testing.
* Tests are organized into files corresponding to the core and problem modules within the `tests/` directory.
* Tests cover various scenarios, including successful cases, failure cases, boundary cases, and multiple solutions.

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1. Data Representation

* **Lists:** Represented as Lua tables (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`).
* **Variables:** Represented as `{type = "var", id = <unique_id>}`.
* **Values:** Represented as `{type = "val", value = <value>}`.
* **Pairs:** Represented as `{type = "pair", left = <term>, right = <term>}`.

### 4.2. Stream Implementation

* Lua coroutines are used to implement lazy streams, enabling efficient generation of solutions.

### 4.3. Unification

* The `unify` function implements the core unification algorithm, handling variable binding and term comparison.

### 4.4. Goal Combinators

* `conj` and `disj` provide the ability to combine goals using logical AND and OR operators.
* `call_fresh` introduces new logic variables into the goal evaluation.

## 5. Testing Strategy

* **MicroKanren Core Tests:** Verify the correctness of the core functions, including unification, stream operations, and goal combinators.
* **Problem Solution Tests:** Ensure that each problem solution produces the expected results for various inputs.
* **Test Coverage:** Aim for comprehensive test coverage, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
* **Continuous Integration:** Integrate automated testing into a CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure code quality.

# Problem 01: Find the Last Element of a List

## Problem Description

Find the last element of a list.

Example:
```
?- my_last(X, [a, b, c, d]).
X = d
```

## Logic Programming Approach

This problem is solved using logic programming with microKanren. The solution uses a relational approach to find the last element of a list:

1. Base case: For a single-element list `[X]`, the last element is `X`
2. Recursive case: For a list `[H|T]`, the last element is the last element of `T`

The implementation uses:
- Logic variables
- Unification
- Disjunction for case handling
- Conjunction for constraints
- Fresh variable creation

## Current Implementation

The current implementation successfully applies the logic programming approach for:
- Single-element lists (e.g., `{1}`, `{42}`)
- Lists of boolean values (e.g., `{true, false, true}`)

For other cases, there are limitations in the current microKanren implementation that prevent the logic program from generating results. In these cases, the code falls back to a direct implementation to ensure correct behavior while the logic-based approach is being improved.

```lua
function M.lasto(lst, last)
  -- Base case: For a list with a single element [X], X is the last element
  local base_case = mk["=="](lst, mk.pair(last, mk.val(nil)))
  
  -- Recursive case: For a list [H|T], the last element is the last element of T
  local recursive_case = mk.call_fresh(function(head)
    return mk.call_fresh(function(tail)
      return mk.conj(
        mk["=="](lst, mk.pair(head, tail)),
        M.lasto(tail, last)
      )
    end)
  end)
  
  -- A list's last element is either from the base case or the recursive case
  return mk.disj(base_case, recursive_case)
end
```

## Testing

The solution is tested against various cases including:
- Single-element lists
- Multiple-element lists
- Lists with different data types:
  - Integers
  - Floating-point numbers
  - Strings
  - Booleans

Our test suite compares the results of the logic-based solution with a direct implementation to validate correctness.

## Future Improvements

Future work could focus on:
1. Enhancing the microKanren implementation to handle more complex unification cases
2. Supporting full recursion through lists with various data types
3. Improving the performance for longer lists
